### Update

[2023/02/09] We re-package the Bi-DexHands. Now you can call the Bi-DexHands' environments not only on the command line, but also in your Python script. check our README [Use Bi-DexHands in Python scripts](#Use-Bi-DexHands-in-Python-scripts) below.

[2022/11/24] Now we support visual observation for all the tasks, check this [document for visual input](#./docs/visual-in.md).

[2022/10/02] Now we support for the default IsaacGymEnvs RL library [rl-games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games), check our README [below](#Use-rl_games-to-train-our-tasks).

**Bi-DexHands** ([click bi-dexhands.ai](https://bi-dexhands.ai)) provides a collection of bimanual dexterous manipulations tasks and reinforcement learning algorithms. 
Reaching human-level sophistication of hand dexterity and bimanual coordination remains an open challenge for modern robotics researchers. To better help the community study this problem, Bi-DexHands are developed with the following key features:
- **Isaac Efficiency**: Bi-DexHands is built within [Isaac Gym](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-gym); it supports running thousands of environments simultaneously. For example, on one NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU, Bi-DexHands can reach **40,000+ mean FPS** by running  2,048  environments in parallel. 
- **Comprehensive RL Benchmark**: we provide the first bimanual manipulation task environment for RL, MARL, Multi-task RL, Meta RL, and Offline RL practitioners, along with a comprehensive benchmark for SOTA continuous control model-free RL/MARL methods. See [example](./bidexhands/algorithms/marl/)
- **Heterogeneous-agents Cooperation**: Agents in Bi-DexHands (i.e., joints, fingers, hands,...) are genuinely heterogeneous; this is very different from common multi-agent environments such as [SMAC](https://github.com/oxwhirl/smac)  where agents can simply share parameters to solve the task. 
- **Task Generalization**: we introduce a variety of dexterous manipulation tasks (e.g., handover, lift up, throw, place, put...) as well as enormous target objects from the [YCB](https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/projects/posecnn/) and [SAPIEN](https://sapien.ucsd.edu/) dataset (>2,000 objects); this allows meta-RL and multi-task RL algorithms to be tested on the task generalization front. 
- **Point Cloud**: We provide the ability to use point clouds as observations. We used the depth camera in Isaacc Gym to get the depth image and then convert it to partial point cloud. We can customize the pose and numbers of depth cameras to get point cloud from difference angles. The density of generated point cloud depends on the number of the camera pixels. See the [visual input docs](./docs/point-cloud.md).

## Introduction

This repository contains complex dexterous hands control tasks. Bi-DexHands is built in the NVIDIA Isaac Gym with high performance guarantee for training RL algorithms. Our environments focus on applying model-free RL/MARL algorithms for bimanual dexterous manipulation, which are considered as a challenging task for traditional control methods. 

## Getting Started

### <span id="task">Tasks</span>

Source code for tasks can be found in `envs/tasks`. The detailed settings of state/action/reward are in [here](./docs/environments.md).

So far, we release the following tasks (with many more to come):

| Environments | Description | Demo     |
|  :----:  | :----:  | :----:  |
|ShadowHand Over| These environments involve two fixed-position hands. The hand which starts with the object must find a way to hand it over to the second hand. | <img src="assets/image_folder/0v2.gif" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandCatch Underarm|These environments again have two hands, however now they have some additional degrees of freedom that allows them to translate/rotate their centre of masses within some constrained region. | <img src="assets/image_folder/hand_catch_underarmv2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandCatch Over2Underarm| This environment is made up of half ShadowHandCatchUnderarm and half ShadowHandCatchOverarm, the object needs to be thrown from the vertical hand to the palm-up hand | <img src="assets/image_folder/2v2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandCatch Abreast| This environment is similar to ShadowHandCatchUnderarm, the difference is that the two hands are changed from relative to side-by-side posture. | <img src="assets/image_folder/1v2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandCatch TwoCatchUnderarm| These environments involve coordination between the two hands so as to throw the two objects between hands (i.e. swapping them). | <img src="assets/image_folder/two_catchv2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandLift Underarm | This environment requires grasping the pot handle with two hands and lifting the pot to the designated position  | <img src="assets/image_folder/3v2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandDoor OpenInward | This environment requires the closed door to be opened, and the door can only be pulled inwards | <img src="assets/image_folder/door_open_inwardv2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandDoor OpenOutward | This environment requires a closed door to be opened and the door can only be pushed outwards  | <img src="assets/image_folder/open_outwardv2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandDoor CloseInward | This environment requires the open door to be closed, and the door is initially open inwards | <img src="assets/image_folder/close_inwardv2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHand BottleCap | This environment involves two hands and a bottle, we need to hold the bottle with one hand and open the bottle cap with the other hand  | <img src="assets/image_folder/bottle_capv2.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |

|ShadowHandOpen PenCap | This environment requires both hands to cooperate to open the pen cap  | <img src="assets/image_folder/pen.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandSwing Cup | This environment requires two hands to hold the cup handle and rotate it 90 degrees | <img src="assets/image_folder/swing_cup.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandTurn Botton | This environment requires both hands to press the button | <img src="assets/image_folder/switch.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |
|ShadowHandGrasp AndPlace | This environment has a bucket and an object, we need to put the object into the bucket  | <img src="assets/image_folder/g&p.gif" align="middle" width="250"/>    |


### Training

#### Training Examples

##### RL/MARL Examples
For example, if you want to train a policy for the ShadowHandOver task by the PPO algorithm, run this line in `bidexhands` folder:

```bash
python train.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=ppo
```

To select an algorithm, pass `--algo=ppo/mappo/happo/hatrpo/...` 
as an argument. For example, if you want to use happo algorithm, run this line in `bidexhands` folder:

```bash
python train.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=happo

#### Gym-Like API

We provide a Gym-Like API that allows us to get information from the Isaac Gym environment. Our single-agent Gym-Like wrapper is the code of the Isaac Gym team used, and we have developed a multi-agent Gym-Like wrapper based on it:

```python
class MultiVecTaskPython(MultiVecTask):
    # Get environment state information
    def get_state(self):
        return torch.clamp(self.task.states_buf, -self.clip_obs, self.clip_obs).to(self.rl_device)

    def step(self, actions):
        # Stack all agent actions in order and enter them into the environment
        a_hand_actions = actions[0]
        for i in range(1, len(actions)):
            a_hand_actions = torch.hstack((a_hand_actions, actions[i]))
        actions = a_hand_actions
        # Clip the actions
        actions_tensor = torch.clamp(actions, -self.clip_actions, self.clip_actions)
        self.task.step(actions_tensor)
        # Obtain information in the environment and distinguish the observation of different agents by hand
        obs_buf = torch.clamp(self.task.obs_buf, -self.clip_obs, self.clip_obs).to(self.rl_device)
        hand_obs = []
        hand_obs.append(torch.cat([obs_buf[:, :self.num_hand_obs], obs_buf[:, 2*self.num_hand_obs:]], dim=1))
        hand_obs.append(torch.cat([obs_buf[:, self.num_hand_obs:2*self.num_hand_obs], obs_buf[:, 2*self.num_hand_obs:]], dim=1))
        rewards = self.task.rew_buf.unsqueeze(-1).to(self.rl_device)
        dones = self.task.reset_buf.to(self.rl_device)
        # Organize information into Multi-Agent RL format
        # Refer to https://github.com/tinyzqh/light_mappo/blob/HEAD/envs/env.py
        sub_agent_obs = []
        ...
        sub_agent_done = []
        for i in range(len(self.agent_index[0] + self.agent_index[1])):
            ...
            sub_agent_done.append(dones)
        # Transpose dim-0 and dim-1 values
        obs_all = torch.transpose(torch.stack(sub_agent_obs), 1, 0)
        ...
        done_all = torch.transpose(torch.stack(sub_agent_done), 1, 0)
        return obs_all, state_all, reward_all, done_all, info_all, None

    def reset(self):
        # Use a random action as the first action after the environment reset
        actions = 0.01 * (1 - 2 * torch.rand([self.task.num_envs, self.task.num_actions * 2], dtype=torch.float32, device=self.rl_device))
        # step the simulator
        self.task.step(actions)
        # Get the observation and state buffer in the environment, the detailed are the same as step(self, actions)
        obs_buf = torch.clamp(self.task.obs_buf, -self.clip_obs, self.clip_obs)
        ...
        obs = torch.transpose(torch.stack(sub_agent_obs), 1, 0)
        state_all = torch.transpose(torch.stack(agent_state), 1, 0)
        return obs, state_all, None
```
#### RL/Multi-Agent RL API

We also provide single-agent and multi-agent RL interfaces. In order to adapt to Isaac Gym and speed up the running efficiency, all operations are implemented on GPUs using tensor. Therefore, there is no need to transfer data between the CPU and GPU.

We give an example using ***HATRPO (the SOTA MARL algorithm for cooperative tasks)*** to illustrate multi-agent RL APIs, please refer to [https://github.com/cyanrain7/TRPO-in-MARL](https://github.com/cyanrain7/TRPO-in-MARL):

```python
from algorithms.marl.hatrpo_trainer import HATRPO as TrainAlgo
from algorithms.marl.hatrpo_policy import HATRPO_Policy as Policy
...
# warmup before the main loop starts
self.warmup()
# log data
start = time.time()
episodes = int(self.num_env_steps) // self.episode_length // self.n_rollout_threads
train_episode_rewards = torch.zeros(1, self.n_rollout_threads, device=self.device)
# main loop
for episode in range(episodes):
    if self.use_linear_lr_decay:
        self.trainer.policy.lr_decay(episode, episodes)
    done_episodes_rewards = []
    for step in range(self.episode_length):
        # Sample actions
        values, actions, action_log_probs, rnn_states, rnn_states_critic = self.collect(step)
        # Obser reward and next obs
        obs, share_obs, rewards, dones, infos, _ = self.envs.step(actions)
        dones_env = torch.all(dones, dim=1)
        reward_env = torch.mean(rewards, dim=1).flatten()
        train_episode_rewards += reward_env
        # Record reward at the end of each episode
        for t in range(self.n_rollout_threads):
            if dones_env[t]:
                done_episodes_rewards.append(train_episode_rewards[:, t].clone())
                train_episode_rewards[:, t] = 0

        data = obs, share_obs, rewards, dones, infos, \
                values, actions, action_log_probs, \
                rnn_states, rnn_states_critic
        # insert data into buffer
        self.insert(data)

    # compute return and update network
    self.compute()
    train_infos = self.train()
    # post process
    total_num_steps = (episode + 1) * self.episode_length * self.n_rollout_threads
    # save model
    if (episode % self.save_interval == 0 or episode == episodes - 1):
        self.save()
```

### Testing

The trained model will be saved to `logs/${Task Name}/${Algorithm Name}`folder.

To load a trained model and only perform inference (no training), pass `--test` 
as an argument, and pass `--model_dir` to specify the trained models which you want to load.
For single-agent reinforcement learning, you need to pass `--model_dir` to specify exactly what .pt model you want to load. An example of PPO algorithm is as follows:

```bash
python train.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=ppo --model_dir=logs/shadow_hand_over/ppo/ppo_seed0/model_5000.pt --test
```

For multi-agent reinforcement learning, pass `--model_dir` to specify the path to the folder where all your agent model files are saved. An example of HAPPO algorithm is as follows:

```bash
python train.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=happo --model_dir=logs/shadow_hand_over/happo/models_seed0 --test
```

### Plotting

Users can convert all tfevent files into csv files and then try plotting the results. Note that you should verify `env-num` and `env-step` same as your experimental setting. For the details, please refer to the `./utils/logger/tools.py`.

```bash
# geenrate csv for sarl and marl algorithms
$ python ./utils/logger/tools.py --alg-name <sarl algorithm> --alg-type sarl --env-num 2048 --env-step 8 --root-dir ./logs/shadow_hand_over --refresh 
$ python ./utils/logger/tools.py --alg-name <marl algorithm> --alg-type marl --env-num 2048 --env-step 8 --root-dir ./logs/shadow_hand_over --refresh 
# generate figures
$ python ./utils/logger/plotter.py --root-dir ./logs/shadow_hand_over --shaded-std --legend-pattern "\\w+"  --output-path=./logs/shadow_hand_over/figure.png
```

### Use Bi-DexHands in Python scripts

```python
import bidexhands as bi
import torch

env_name = 'ShadowHandOver'
algo = "ppo"
env = bi.make(env_name, algo)

obs = env.reset()
terminated = False

while not terminated:
    act = torch.tensor(env.action_space.sample()).repeat((env.num_envs, 1))
    obs, reward, done, info = env.step(act)
```

## Enviroment Performance

### Figures

We provide stable and reproducible baselins run by **PPO, HAPPO, MAPPO, SAC** algorithms. All baselines are run under the parameters of `2048 num_env` and `100M total_step`. The `dataset` folder contains the raw csv files.

<!-- ## Building the Documentation

To build documentation in various formats, you will need [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the
readthedocs theme.

```bash
cd docs/
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
You can then build the documentation by running `make <format>` from the
`docs/` folder. Run `make` to get a list of all available output formats.

If you get a katex error run `npm install katex`.  If it persists, try
`npm install -g katex` -->

## Offline RL Datasets

### Data Collection

`ppo_collect` is the algo that collects offline data, which is basically the same as the mujoco data collection in d4rl. Firstly train the PPO for 5000 iterations, and collect and save the demonstration data in the first 2500 iterations:

```bash
python train.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=ppo_collection --num_envs=2048 --headless
```

Select model_5000.pt as the export policy to collect the expert dataset:

```bash
python3	train.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=ppo_collect --model_dir=./logs/shadow_hand_over/ppo_collect/ppo_collect_seed-1/model_5000.pt --test --num_envs=200 --headless
```

Similarly, select model.pt as the random policy, select a model as the medium policy, collect random data and medium data as above, and evenly sample the replay data set from the demonstration data before training to the medium policy. The size of each dataset is 10e6. Run merge.py to get the medium-expert dataset.

### Offline Data

The originally collected data in our paper is available at: 
[Shadow Hand Over](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/74F68A12FFE4A12048604CFC37A54F9C), 
[Shadow Hand Door Open Outward](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/A696D1FF69D60AC2E3E033C4567C108E).

### Use rl_games to train our tasks

**Please note that we have only test to support rl-games==1.5.2. Higher or lower version may cause an error.**

For example, if you want to train a policy for the ShadowHandOver task by the PPO algorithm, run this line in `bidexhands` folder:

```bash
python train_rlgames.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=ppo
```

Currently we only support PPO and PPO with LSTM methods in rl_games. If you want to use PPO with LSTM, run this line in `bidexhands` folder:

```bash
python train_rlgames.py --task=ShadowHandOver --algo=ppo_lstm
``` 

The log files using rl_games can be found in `bidexhands/runs` folder.

## Known issue

It must be pointed out that Bi-DexHands is still under development, and there are some known issue: 
- Some environments may report errors due to PhysX's collision calculation bugs in the later stage of program runtime.
```
RuntimeError: CUDA error: an illegal memory access was encountered
CUDA kernel errors might be asynchronously reported at some other API call,so the stacktrace below might be incorrect.
```
- Although we provide the implementation, we did not tested **DDPG**, **TD3**, and **MADDPG** algorithms, they may still have bugs.

## Future Plan
 - [x] Success Metric for all tasks
 - [ ] Add fatory environment (see [this](https://sites.google.com/nvidia.com/factory))
 - [x] Add support for the default IsaacGymEnvs RL library [rl-games](https://github.com/Denys88/rl_games)
